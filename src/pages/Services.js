              A trailer washout will help eliminate any germs or residue that
              might be left behind by old materials. It will also ensure you
              donâ€™t contaminate the new cargo.
              <br />
              <br />
              First, we rinse the area out and remove any lingering debris,
              spray down the entire trailer with soap and let it soak for
              several minutes. Finally, we will high pressure the soap residue
              off and rinse.
              <br />
              <br />
              We will use a blower so it can be completely dry before you add
              the next trip of cargo.
